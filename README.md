## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is BenoÃ®t Joseph Clotaire Edouard LEVEUGLE (I don't know why we have so many names in France... ğŸ¤”).

I live with my family ğŸŒ± near the Atlantic Ocean, in a small city called Auray. We are an international family, my spouse being Lebanon.

I currently work for Nimbix, a US team, as a swiss knife developer/system administrator (bare metal and k8s) in High Performance Computing.

In my free time, I work on the BlueBanquise stack project (github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise), in the hope it can help others.

You can reach me at oxedions@gmail.com ğŸ“«, please do not hesitate ğŸ˜Š
