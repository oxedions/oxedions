## Hi there 👋

My name is Benoît Joseph Clotaire Edouard LEVEUGLE (I don't know why we have so many names in France... 🤔).

I live with my family 🌱 near the Atlantic Ocean, in a small city called Auray. We are an international family, my spouse being Lebanon.

I currently work for Nimbix, a US team, as a swiss knife developer/system administrator (bare metal and k8s) in High Performance Computing.

In my free time, I work on the [BlueBanquise stack project](https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise), in the hope it can help others.

You can reach me at oxedions@gmail.com 📫, please do not hesitate 😊
